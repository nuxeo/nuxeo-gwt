     * The way extension is contributed. This is a hint to the extension point.
     * Some extension points may simply ignore this.
     * <p>
     * Remember that hints are dependent on extension point capabilities. So
     * before using them you must read the target extension point documentation.
     * Also, implementors MUST use a coherent hint system. It is recommended to
     * follow the system described below.
     * <p>
     * There are two type of extension points:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Containers - that manage a set of contributions. This type of
     * containers may be ordered so having an index to control the order when
     * inserting contributions may be important. So in this case the hint can be
     * used to either specify an index >=0, either specify the APPEND value
     * (which usually have the same meaning as DEFAULT)
     *
     * <li>Providers - that manage only one contribution This type of containers
     * have no ordering but may wants to know if the contribution must replace
     * the existing one or if it should be merged against the existing one. For
     * this type of extension points we provide 3 hints:
     * <ul>
     * <li>APPEND - merge with existing contribution if any
     * <li>REPLACE - replace existing contribution if any
     * <li>AS_DEFAULT - deploy it only if no previous contribution was deployed
     * </ul>
     * </ol>
     *
     * Note that we define a DEFAULT value that can be used to specify the
     * DEFAULT registration hint defined by the target container. The DEFAULT is
     * usually an APPEND or a REPLACE.
     * <p>
     * Also, note that when using indexes >= 0 to control the order the indexes
     * may have any value. They are not representing the real index in the
     * target container but a sort of 'weight' to be used to control ordering.
