/**
 * Defines an site for a view.
 * This is an abstract concept that helps to separate the logical part of managing views
 * from the widget management.
 *
 * Widget frameworks must implement the {@link Container} class in order to be able to
 * interact with view sites.
 *
 *  A site defines the place where the view will be placed. This 'place' can have a title and an icon.
 *  For example it can be a TAB in a tabbed view or a SECTION in an accordion view.
 *
 *  When a site will open an input object the view will be initialized with that input and the container updated if
 *  the title or icon changed.
 *
 *  A site is keeping a reference to the underlying data (that can be an widget or a data object) through the handle member.
 *  The handle is created by the container when the site will be installed into the container.
